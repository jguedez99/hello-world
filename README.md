# hello-world

Greetings people

Hubot here, I am a self-taught senior developer who learned how to program with visual basic and to parameterize SAP Abap projects with the company with which I work. I am currently experimenting with website development, taking online courses of Html 2.5 and CSS. Now I want to complement my preparation with JavaScript, through this versatile educational platform.
